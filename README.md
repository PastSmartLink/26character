# MMCOS – Multi-Agent AI Marketing Co-Pilot  

**Cognitive Agent System for Domain-Specific Asset Generation**

---

## Problem / Opportunity

MMCOS addresses the inefficiency in content generation by proving that domain-smart, **multi-agent orchestration** can turn a one-line goal into **production-ready assets** in seconds, surpassing general-purpose LLMs.

This project showcases:

1. **Agent Orchestration** (`ChiefScoutAgent` -> `PlannerAgent` -> `OrchestratorAgent` -> `RefinerAgent`).
2. **Domain-Specific Model Context** (Selects between `TELEMEDICINE_PLANNER`, `GOOGLE_PIXEL_PLANNER`, etc.).
3. **Scalable Deployment** (Production-ready Python + Gunicorn `Dockerfile`).
